This project needs a better name.  Right now, I suppose it all
qualifies as a crude hack -- there's a lot of refactoring to be done.
This originally used CL-SDL, but I switched to my own minimal
implementation of functions in C due to an insane number of
FFI-related hassles I was having, particularly to do with efficiency.



Caveats to level designers:

* Places where there are no floor tiles cannot be crossed by the
player, even if there are other things above the floor.  Use an
invisible floor tile or similar instead.

* You can put a big tile (like a hedge or block) in the floor, but it
will always have the clip rectangle of a floor tile, and it won't
animate.


Refactorings:

Lots of stuff should be more data driven:
	event handling in editors.

Reduce duplication of code:
	collision detection/resolution.

Fix comments, function documentation, and document any assumptions.

Physical structure of the code needs to be rearranged to better
reflect dependencies, so that initial load of the code doesn't have so
many warnings.
