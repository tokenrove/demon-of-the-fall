* DEMON OF THE FALL

This was intended to be my [[http://onegameamonth.com][#1GAM]] game for February, but this game will
have to wait a little longer.  It was originally written, in 2004, as
a Solstice/Equinox clone, with some influence from Head-Over-Heels.
I've recently tried to bring it back to life, but much more work will
be required to extract it from the bad decisions of the past.
